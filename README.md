# Whizz80

The Whizz80 is a z80 based computer built from scratch running a Forth like operating system. The goal is to have a complete stand alone computer (with its own input/output devices, not relying on a tether from another computer like a serial connection).

This is quite an ambitious project, and I suspect it will take me some time to do (and I may not even complete it).

Right now I'm just playing with the hardware working out and trying different ideas and concepts.

The documentation of this project is hosted on [Whizz80](http://www.whizz80.com).
